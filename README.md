Wild Selfie Dataset (WSD)

Introduction
The Wild Selfie Dataset (WSD) contains the selfie images captured from the cameras of different smart phones, unlike existing datasets where most of the images are captured in controlled environment. The WSD dataset contains 45,424 images from 42 individuals (i.e., 24 female and 18 male subjects), which are divided into 40,862 training and 4,562 test images. The average number of images per subject is 1,082 with minimum and maximum number of images for any subject are 518 and 2,634, respectively. The proposed dataset consists of several challenges, including but not limited to augmented reality filtering, mirrored images, occlusion, illumination, scale, expressions, view-point, aspect ratio, blur, partial faces, rotation, and alignment.

Any work made public, whatever the form, based directly or indirectly on any part of this Dataset has to include the following reference:
